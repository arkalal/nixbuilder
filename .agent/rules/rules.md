# Rules

- Never use typescript and Tailwind CSS.
- if require to install an NPM package, always analyse the package.json file and find out which package needs to be installed as per requirement and install it.
- ALwasy use "use client" at the top of functional components which is using client side code like react hooks but not for all components.
- Never write refresh setInterval logics meaninglessly unless instructed.
- ALways use this method - "../../../" for importing in the components.
- We use NPM so always use that. No Yarn.
- Under the src folder, only the app folder will be there under which we will have the api folder which is the normal NextJS app router concept, but apart from them all the other folders like utils etc, will be under the root project.
- All the components will be under the components folder under the root project.
- There must be no duplication of same files or having any empty folders in the project. Always check that. If you find it, then remove it after checking which is important to keep.
- Never break or disturb any other existing code, functionalities or UI while coding something or implementing some changes or doing some task as instructed.
- Never change or update any code if not instructed. Only Stick to the specific task that has been instructed to you to do.
- If we are using mongoose schema then always create a models folder in the root of the project where you will create the schema JS files.
- Do not miss any points that I have explained to you. Make sure you follow and implement each and everything that I have told you in the cascade composer.
- ALways search the web and research if you have any confusion while fixing an error for clarity. so that you make no mistakes and do it perfectly.
- Make sure our project is highly and completely secured, so that once launched in production, it should not get hacked or attacked by hackers or have any unethical access by bots. It must be a completely safe and secured working product for its users - VERY IMPORTANT!!

# Images to Coding the UI

- If you are given an UI image and asked to build the excat UI as shown in the image pixel perfectly with no changes, analyse the UI components, styles, colors, alignments, shades, animations everything shown in the image attached and code the excat replica of the UI shown in the image. You must be the perfect analyser of the image and convert and clone the UI shown in the image into excat real UI in our app if instructed with no changes. The UI in our app should be the same as shown in the image attached.

Make the excat replica of this UI as you can see in the image attached.

Observe the detailing of the UI in the image, the components, colors, texts, fonts, gradients, styling, alignments, shapes and everything and convert the UI shown in the image to the real UI in this project. There must not be even 1% change in the UI that you will code and build. It must be excatly the same as shown in the image attached.

Do it perfectly without breaking any other existing code.
